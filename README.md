# Pydantic AI & Ollama Local Agent Prototype

## Overview
This is an experimental engineering notebook entry demonstrating the integration of PydanticAI and Ollama to create a local AI agent capable of using tools. It serves as a proof-of-concept and learning resource for building intelligent, context-aware agents using open-source AI technologies.

## Key Features
- Utilizes PydanticAI for structured AI interactions
- Leverages Ollama for local AI model inference
- Implements a tool-using agent with intent extraction
- Demonstrates note creation, reading, and listing functionality

## Technical Highlights
- Dynamic intent understanding
- Flexible tool-based agent design
- Local AI processing with Ollama
- Pydantic-based data validation and modeling

## Purpose
This project is not a production-ready application, but rather:
- An exploration of AI agent capabilities
- A reference implementation for AI tool integration
- A learning resource for AI engineering techniques

## Technologies
- PydanticAI
- Ollama
- Python asyncio
- Local AI inference

## Running the Prototype
```bash
python crud_agent.py
```

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by Skolo Online's YouTube tutorial [Building a CRUD AI Agent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAbyC1kMj5w). Key differences from the original implementation:
- Uses flat files instead of a database for storage
- Utilizes Ollama for local LLM inference

The original tutorial demonstrated a powerful concept of an AI agent with tool-using capabilities, which served as a foundational inspiration for this prototype.

## Experimental Notes
This doesn't include all elements of CRUD for brevity.
